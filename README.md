## Overview

This project consists of both frontend and backend components for building a GraphQL-based application. The frontend is built using Svelte and Urql, while the backend is implemented in both Python and TypeScript.

### Python Backend

The Python backend is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for handling HTTP requests and database operations. The GraphQL layer is powered by Strawberry. The entire backend is containerized using Docker for easy deployment. PostgreSQL is used as the database.

### TypeScript Backend

The TypeScript backend is built using Fastify and TypeORM for handling HTTP requests and database operations. It uses Mercurius as the GraphQL library. The backend is also containerized using Docker for efficient deployment. PostgreSQL is used as the database.
